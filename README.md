# Monte_Carlo_Simulation

For this simulation we used the matplotlib and pygame libraries, 
the first to show the variation of the number Pi as a function of 
the number of iterations. The second didactically displays the algorithm's 
working mechanism, where you have a set of points randomly distributed in the 
figure, when they are inside the quadrant of the circle, count ( inCircle += 1), 
this value is divided by the total number of points distributed in the figure.
